\title{Table of movement processes.}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 5 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{name}{Full descriptive name of the model (e.g., "Ind. Ident.
Distr. (IID)"). Used throughout \code{ctmm}. See reference for more
details on each model and their properties.}
\item{name_short}{Abbreviated name, used where space is limited.}
\item{tau_p}{Logical. TRUE if the model includes the position
autocorrelation timescale (i.e., home range crossing time).}
\item{tau_v}{Logical. TRUE if the model includes the velocity
autocorrelation timescale (i.e., directional persistence).}
\item{hrange}{Logical; TRUE if the model supports range residency,
meaning the animal is likely to remain within a bounded area or
"home range" instead of expanding indefinitely.}
\item{pars}{Character string summarizing which autocorrelation
parameters (e.g., tau_p, tau_v) the model estimates. Shown in HTML
for documentation.}
...

}
\usage{
movmods
}
\description{
Lists all continuous-time movement process models in \pkg{ctmm}.
Each row is a different movement model applicable for animal movement.
