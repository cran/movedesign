# Resolving installation issues

## Check package dependencies:

The `movedesign` package requires many non-default `R` packages. If you are met with errors during installation/updates, try restarting your `R` session (in the `RStudio` menu bar, this is `Session` \> `Restart R`; or close and re-open `R`). Then, reinstall the package using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ecoisilva/movedesign", dependencies = TRUE) 
```

You may also need to explicitly install the `fontawesome` package:

``` r
install.packages("fontawesome")
```

## Resolving "failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub":

If you see this error when installing from GitHub, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Generate a GitHub personal access token with the following command in the RStudio or `R` console:

``` r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

This will take you to GitHub to generate a token. Configure the token (or just scroll down and generate it using the default settings) and copy it to your clipboard (it is a string of letters and numbers).

**Step 2:** Save the personal access token in your R environment. Back in `R`, enter:

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

This will open the `.Renviron` file in a new RStudio window. Add the following line to the file:

```         
GITHUB_PAT="GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Replace `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you just copied from GitHub.

**Step 3:** Save this file, close it, and restart `R`. After that, you should be able to install `movedesign` through the usual command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ecoisilva/movedesign", dependencies = TRUE) 
```
